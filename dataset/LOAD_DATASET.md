# How to load real-world dataset

Please download the necessary real-world datasets from the provided GitHub link above. These datasets are required for running benchmarks 10 through 13.

The real-world datasets used for some benchmarks (e.g., `fb`, `books`, `wiki`, `osm`) are large and therefore not included in this repository. You can download these datasets from the following GitHub repository: [GRE Index Datasets](https://github.com/gre4index/GRE.git). 

## Note

Currently, you can download the data files in text format from the following Google Drive links. Each file contains data for fb, books, wiki, and osm.

- [Download fb.txt](https://drive.google.com/file/d/116TlXFi0BwHp-cag-HF9ZP-upzPDWwq9/view?usp=sharing)
- [Download books.txt](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Wh3pE9mQVXYQ9nOWCKrAIHi9Esss6clb/view?usp=sharing)
- [Download wiki.txt](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FMLksETjoxpu0XvykGKCEbppjOh3sYro/view?usp=sharing)
- [Download osm.txt](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1J7ZjiI8HuD0KDFx3cqpzqwFe3u56TOwD/view?usp=sharing)

After downloading, make sure to place the datasets in the appropriate directory as expected by the benchmark scripts.

## Parsing Code

Parsing code to process the downloaded data files is currently under preparation. It will be uploaded to this repository in the future, and this `LOAD_DATASET.md` file will also be updated accordingly. Until then, you can use the raw text files directly for testing purposes.
