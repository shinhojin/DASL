# How to load real-world dataset

Please download the necessary real-world datasets from the provided GitHub link above. These datasets are required for running benchmarks 9 through 12.

The real-world datasets used for some benchmarks (e.g., `fb`, `books`, `wiki`, `osm`) are large and therefore not included in this repository. You can download these datasets from the following GitHub repository: [GRE Index Datasets](https://github.com/gre4index/GRE.git). After downloading, make sure to place the datasets in the appropriate directory as expected by the benchmark scripts.
